            <h5><b>A brief synopsis...</b></h5>
    		<p>My lab is among those that, in the late 1980â€™s, showed that integrins not only mediate physical attachment of cells to extracellular matrix but also transduce signals that inform the cell about its environment. We were responsible for identifying the Na+-H+ antiporter [1, 2], calcium channels [3, 4], c Abl [5], phosphatidylinositol 5 kinase and Rho family GTPases [6-8] as mediators of integrin signaling. We were the first to report that integrin-mediated cell adhesion promotes cell survival [9]. We were also the first to show that growth factor receptor signaling is modulated by cell adhesion and have identified several mechanisms to account for the effects [6, 10-13]. We have developed several of the widely used tools in these areas, including the pull down assay for measuring Rho activity state [14] and the fluorescence based tension sensor for measuring forces across specific proteins [15]. </p>
    		<p>A key concept throughout these studies has been that cells base their major decisions on integrated information from their environment. Our early work showed that anchorage dependence of growth, i.e., that normal cells must adhere to ECM in order to grow is because signals from integrins are required to support and sustain signals from growth factors [1, 16, 17]. Conversely, growth of cancer cells becomes anchorage-independent because downstream pathways are constitutively activated. This feature correlates closely with tumorigenesis in vivo, in particular with the ability of cancer cells to invade other tissues and metastasize to distant sites. Thus, integrin signals mediate positional specificity within multicellular organisms and constitutive activation of these pathways enable cancer cells to colonize inappropriate environments.</p>
    		<p>Later work expanded these interests into mechanotransduction, how cells sense and respond to physical stimuli. We discovered that application of fluid shear stress to vascular endothelial cells triggers conformational activation of integrins, binding of these newly activated integrins to the extracellular matrix, and subsequent signaling [18, 19] . This work led to elucidation of the junctional mechanosensory complex, the first well validated mechanotransducers for fluid shear stress [20]. It also led to identification of extracellular matrix as a key modulator of fluid shear stress signaling and atherosclerosis [21, 22]. Development of the tension sensor to measure forces across specific molecules permitted further elucidation of the molecular mechanisms in this system [23].</p>
